# Frisbee_Measure_Project
Using this repo as a documentation place for my Frisbee Measure Project
### Brainstorming
Using a gryoscope and a pi in the sky to measure the difference in rotation speed between the backhand throw and forehand throw to see which one might spin faster. We could also make the mount able to attach other kinds of frisbees like frisbee golf discs to see how much faster those might spin then the normal frisbee. Using the gryoscope we can measure angular velocity, but also measure the acceleration in all three directions, x, y, and also z. Being able to measure these gives us the ability to back track and measure x y and z velocities to tell us how fast its going in those directions, and also possible measure displacement instead of using a GPS module, but could be prone to having miscalculations. We were thinking that the best way to mount all of this stuff to a frisbee without altering the data would be to mount it to the bottom of the frisbee and make it thin enough that it wont stick out from the overhang that the frisbee already has.
