### Timeline (weekly)

* **01/09/2023** =  completed the wiring circuit for collecting data and making the data collector be powered without any cable connection.

* **01/17/2023** =  Finished CAD Designs of the **enclousure** and placed them for printing.

   * **01/19/2023** = the printed designs were finished but were incorrect. The **enclousure** was too short for the whole circuit, so all the measurements were fixed and checked, and the new enclousure was placed for printing.

* **01/23/23** = the new enclosure is printed

* **01/30/23** = By the end of this week, the module (**circuit** and **enclosure**) will be completed

   * **02/06/23**  = Will find center of mass, and mount module, and mostly likely the first test launch will take place.
   
   * **02/02/2023** = **TimeLine** shortened by ** 1 week** as the **Center of Mass**, **Mounting the Module** on the **Frisbee** *AND* taking a **test launch** completed.
